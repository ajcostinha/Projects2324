The present project was developed under the scope of Storing and Retrieving Data, a SQL online Class.
    
We decided on designing the business process of a online bookshop since this kind of business might rely heavily on a relational database to manage its extensive inventory, streamline customer interactions, process transactions, and ensure efficient order fulfillment.
	
"OnceUponATime" is the name of the fictitious company for which we developed this database. It's an online platform with an extensive catalog of books from different authors and publishers. Its biggest challenge is trying to replicate the experience of buying books in a physical store. As a result of that the company puts all its efforts into making the consumer experience as personalized as possible.
	
More concretely, apart from providing customers with an extensive catalog of books  from different authors that they could explore, the platform also enables the customers to create an account, granting access to their wishlist and recent purchases. Additionally, it provides personalized recommendations and includes a review section where customers can leave their feedback and ratings for books they've read, offering valuable insightsfor other potential buyers.
