For the class Computational Intelligence for Optimization, we were asked to apply our knowledge of Genectic Algorithms (GA) to solve an optimization problem of our choice.

We choose: IMAGE RECREATION
Meaning, the goal was to generate an image that was as close as possible to the target image. For this type of problem, there are some examples we could choose from such as pixels, polygons and even 2D. Ultimatly we chose polygons with colours.
